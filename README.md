# NAME

Tiny::Tiny - minimal minimalism

# VERSION

version 0.001

# SYNOPSIS

    use Tiny::Tiny;

# DESCRIPTION

This module does the tiniest thing of all -- nothing!

Given all the recent releases of `*::Tiny` modules, I felt like I needed to
get in on the action while there was still part of the namespace left.

# SUPPORT

Bugs may be submitted through [the RT bug tracker](https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Tiny-Tiny)
(or [bug-Tiny-Tiny@rt.cpan.org](mailto:bug-Tiny-Tiny@rt.cpan.org)).
I am also usually active on irc, as 'ether' at `irc.perl.org`.
